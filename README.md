# EEG Analysis Pipeline

This repository contains scripts for EEG data analysis, including power spectral density (PSD) computation, coherence analysis, and correlation analysis. These scripts provide basic functionality and can be adapted for specific research needs.

## Power Spectral Density (PSD) Analysis
This script computes the power spectral density (PSD) of EEG data, allowing analysis of frequency components. It provides insights into spectral properties and can be used for basic frequency-domain investigations.

## Coherence Analysis
Computes coherence between EEG channels, offering a measure of functional connectivity. This analysis helps assess synchronization between different brain regions.

## Correlation Analysis
Performs correlation analysis on EEG data, examining relationships between signals from different electrodes. Useful for investigating connectivity patterns in EEG recordings.
